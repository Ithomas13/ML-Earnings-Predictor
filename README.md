## ðŸš€ Overview
This project is a **machine learning and data analysis notebook** designed to identify profitable trading opportunities during high-volatility events, particularly **earnings announcements**.  

Earnings season is one of the most impactful times in the market â€” option premiums swell, implied volatility spikes, and stocks often make sharp moves in a short time window. The goal of this algorithm is to **predict and quantify post-earnings price reactions** so traders can structure smarter options plays (straddles, strangles, or directional bets) with improved risk-reward.

---

## Features
- Historical data analysis of earnings reactions  
- Linear regression model to predict short-term post-earnings price moves  
- Performance evaluation using RMSE and RÂ² metrics  
- Visualizations showing predicted vs. actual stock movement  
- Practical insights for real options strategies (anticipating IV crush or breakouts)

## Installation
Clone the repo and install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Or open instantly with **Google Colab** using the badge above (no setup needed).

---

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>.git
   cd <your-repo>
   ```
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
3. Open `Trading_Insights_Algorithm.ipynb` and run cells step by step.  

---

## Example Output
- Predicted vs. actual stock moves after earnings  
- Forward-looking signals that highlight when a stock is primed for a quick swing  
- Metrics to validate confidence in predictions  

These outputs can be combined with **options strategies** (e.g., buying a straddle when a breakout is likely or selling premium when stability is expected) to make more informed trades.

---

## Future Improvements
- Integrate live earnings calendar & stock data via API  
- Expand beyond linear regression â†’ Random Forest, XGBoost, or LSTMs for deeper predictive power  
- Backtest options strategies (straddle/strangle PnL) on top of model predictions  
- Build a lightweight dashboard for real-time earnings trade planning
